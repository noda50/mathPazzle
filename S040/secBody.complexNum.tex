複素数 $z$ は以下のように表される。
  %%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
  \begin{eqnarray}
    z & = & e^{r + i\theta}
  \end{eqnarray}
  %%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
ここで $z=1$ とすると、
  %%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
  \begin{eqnarray}
    1
      & = &
        z
  \\  
      & = &
        e^{r + i\theta}
  \\
    r
      & = &
        0
  \\
    \theta
      & = &
        2 k \pi
  \\
    k
      & \in &
        \SetInt
  \end{eqnarray}
  %%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
よって、
  %%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
  \begin{eqnarray}
    1^x
      & = &
        z^x
  \\  
      & = &
        e^{x (0 + 2 i k \pi)}
  \\
      & = &
        e^{x (2 i k x \pi)}
  \\
      & = &
        2
  \\
    \log 2 
      & = &
        \log\left(e^{2 i k x \pi}\right)
  \\
      & = &
        2 i k x \pi
  \end{eqnarray}
  %%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
ここで $x = u + i v$ とおいておく。
ただし、$u,v$ は実数とする。
  %%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
  \begin{eqnarray}
    \log 2 
      & = &
        2 i k x \pi
  \\
      & = &
        2 i k (u + iv)
  \\
      & = &
        - 2 k v + 2 i k u
  \\
    u
      & = &
        0
  \\
    v
      & = &
        - \frac{\log 2}{2 k}
  \end{eqnarray}
  %%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
ただし、$k \ne 0$。
よって、解 $x$ は、
  %%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
  \begin{eqnarray}
    x & = &
        \pm \frac{i \log 2}{2 k}
  \\
    k & \in & \SetNat
  \end{eqnarray}
